### 3. 📊 Telecom churn prediction  
- **Goal**: Short description of what problem it solves  
- As part of my data science journey, I developed a churn prediction model aimed at helping telecom companies identify customers at risk of leaving their services. The project involved the complete data science lifecycle — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

📌 Objectives:

Predict customer churn using historical usage and service data
Provide insights to support proactive retention strategies
🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodologies:

Data Cleaning & Exploration: Identified key churn indicators through EDA
Feature Engineering: Transformed raw data to improve model performance
Modeling: Built and compared models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Evaluation: Achieved strong predictive performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
📊 Impact: This project demonstrates how machine learning can empower telecom providers to make data-informed decisions, reduce customer turnover, and improve business outcomes.
