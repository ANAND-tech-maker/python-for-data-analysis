# 🤖 Machine Learning – Learning & Model Building  

This repository contains my **practice notebooks** where I explore and implement  
different **machine learning algorithms** step by step.  

The main objective of this repo is to **learn and build ML models from scratch** using Python,  
focusing on concepts like **data preprocessing, supervised learning, and model evaluation**.
